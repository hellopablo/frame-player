## How to Contribute

I welcome contirbutions to frameplayer. Fork the repo and submit a pull request. Please ensure that frameplayer.js compiles and that any relevant documentation is updated before sending the pull request.

### Compiling the JS

I use Grunt to compile everything. Firstly, install `grunt-cli` tool globally. It's recommended to run the grunt client on a per-project basis.

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Install the dev dependancies in your project:

    npm install --dev

The following Grunt task is available for compiling the JS:

    grunt build

If you want to watch for changes in `src/*.js` files then simply call Grunt with no arguments:

    grunt
